### Points to consider for not using vanilla React

React is a great library for building user interfaces. But it is not a framework. It is a library that is used to build
user interfaces. It does not provide any built-in features for routing, state management, etc. Also the biggest problem
of React is that it is entirely a client side framework. That means it is not SEO friendly at all and also it puts all
the load of data fetching on the client side. This can be a problem for large scale applications.

Moreover, the lack of a set way of doing things like in an opinionated framework can be a problem for large teams. Also
it requires a lot of manual configuration which makes it slow to get started and push a product to the market as quickly
as possible.

### Deployment

This application has been deployed on Netlify. You can check out the live demo [here](https://medium-clone-react-aeonaxy.netlify.app/).
